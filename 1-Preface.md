# Preface

HTML is the foundation of the marvel called the Web.

There is an incredible power underneath this rather simple and limited set of rules, which let us, developers, makers, designers, writers, tinkers, craft documents, apps, experiences for people all around the globe.

My first HTML book is dated 1997 and it was called HTML Unleashed. A big, lots-of-pages long tome.

20+ years have passed and HTML is still the foundation of the Web, with minimal changes from back then.

Sure, we got more semantic tags, presentational HTML is no longer a thing, and CSS has taken care of the design of things.

HTML is successful in one thing: **simplicity**.

It resisted being hijacked into an XML dialect via XHTML, when eventually people realized that thing was way, way too complex.

It did so because of another feature it provides us: **forgiveness**. There are _some_ rules, right, but after you learn those, you have a lot of freedom.

Browsers learned to be resilient, and to always try to do their best when parsing and presenting HTML to the users.

And the whole Web platform did one thing right: it never broke backward compatibility. Pretty incredibly, we can go back to HTML documents written in 1991 and they look pretty much as they looked back then.

Given the evolution in browser UI default styling.

We even know what the first web page was. It's this: http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html

And you can see the source of the page, thanks to another big feature of the Web, and HTML: **we can inspect the HTML of any web page**.

Don't take this for granted. I don't know any other platform that gives us this ability.

The exceptional Developer Tools built into any browser let us inspect and take inspiration from HTML written by anyone in the world.

If you are new to HTML this book aims to help you get started.  If you are a seasoned Web Developer this book will improve your knowledge. 

I learned so much while writing it, even though I'm working with the Web since 20+ years, and I'm sure you'll find something new too.

Or you'll re-learn something old you forgot.

In any case, the goal of the book is to be useful to you, and I hope it succeeds.
