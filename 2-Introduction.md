# Introduction

HTML is a standard defined by the **WHATWG**, an acronym for Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group, an organization formed by people working on the most popular web browser. This means it's basically controlled by Google, Mozilla, Apple and Microsoft.

In the past the **W3C** (World Wide Web Consortium) was the organism in charge of creating the HTML standard.

The control informally moved from W3C to WHATWG when it became clear that the W3C push towards XHTML was not a good idea.

If you've never heard of XHTML, here's a short story. In the early 2000s, we all believed the future of the Web was XML (seriously). So HTML moved from being a SGML-based authoring language to a XML markup language.

It was a big change. We had to know, and respect, more rules. Stricter rules.

Eventually browser vendors realized this was not the right path for the Web and they pushed back, creating what is now known as HTML5.

W3C did not really agree on leaving control of HTML and for years we got 2 competing standards, each one aiming to be the official one. Eventually on 28 May 2019 it was made official by W3C that the "true" HTML version was the one published by WHATWG.

I mentioned HTML5. Let me explain this little story. I know, it's kind of confusing up to now, as with many things in life when many actors are involved, yet it's also fascinating.

We had HTML version 1 in 1993. [Here's the original RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1983).

HTML 2 followed in 1995.

We got **HTML 3** in January 1997, and **HTML 4** in December 1997.

Busy times!

20+ years went by, we had this entire XHTML thing, and eventually we got to this HTML5 "thing", which is not really _just HTML_ any more.

HTML5 is a term that now defines a whole set of technologies, which includes HTML but adds a lot of APIs and standards like WebGL, SVG and more.

The key thing to understand here is this: there is no such thing (any more) as an HTML version now. It's a living standard. Like CSS, we call it 3 but in reality it's a bunch of independent modules developed separately. Like JavaScript, we have one new edition each year, but nowadays, it does not matter any more than than which individual features are implemented by the engine.

Yes we call it HTML5 but HTML4 is from 1997. That's a long time for anything, let alone for the web.

This is where the standard "lives": [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage).
